### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm [Arthur](https://www.arthurnespoulous.com)

## About Me
I have been a front-end developer for over 5 years now. My key skills are Javascript / HTML / CSS as well as other technologies related to front-end development such as Angular, React, Vue, Svelte, Sass, ThreeJs, and Jquery. I also have advanced notions in NodeJs. Passionate about my job, I can quickly build skills on just about any tool.
Constantly researching new technologies to improve myself as a developer, and I always keep up to date with the latest industry trends to ensure optimal results for the projects I work on.
